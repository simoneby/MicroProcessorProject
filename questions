QUESTIONS: (Partly for Kendall and party for Martin) ------------------------------------------------------------------


*Should the writeback always go to the same register? Doesnt make sense tbh, but i don't know how to change between
 A or B without passing more arguments?


*How can I make sure I am using the same Instruciton memory and DataMemory?



ANSWERED: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Do registers work exactly the same as with memory in this project? Im confused
    -> They can, but its simpler just to use a vector.


*Should you do any sort of writeback after a store instruciton?
     -> no


@How can i make sure I access the same registers? I need to read from registers in instruction decode in order
 to pass on the values.
     -> The registers are Vectors initialized in the Instrucion decode file.


*The input and output types of the ALU are signed in order to use negative numbers,
 will this affect the datapath seeing that an Unsigned is passed to the alu, and taken from the ALU again
     -> This is fine as long as you dont compare integers, then it might matter. Right now (Signed in ALU, Unsigned
     elsewhere) is the same hardware.

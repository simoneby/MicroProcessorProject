QUESTIONS: (Partly for Kendall and party for Martin)

1. The input and output types of the ALU are signed in order to use negative numbers,
    will this affect the datapath seeing that an Unsigned is passed to the alu, and taken from the ALU again

2. How can i make sure I access the same registers? I need to read from registers in instruction decode in order
   to pass on the values. Same with Instruciton memory and DataMemory?

3. Is there any writeback when writing data into storage? is it wrong? should there be any? right now it writes back
    0 x 32 to the destination address

4. Do registers work exactly the same as with memory in this project? Im confused
